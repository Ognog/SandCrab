SandCrab CNC Mill Firmware
==========================

Overview
========

Forked from Marlin 3D Printer Firmware, with additional content from GRBL CNC Firmware, SandCrab is CNC Mill Firmware specifically for the Arduino Mega 2560 and Ramps 1.4.

Features:
=========

*   Interrupt based movement with real linear acceleration
*   High steprate
*   Look ahead (Keep the speed high when possible. High cornering speed)
*   Interrupt based temperature protection
*   preliminary support for Matthew Roberts advance algorithm
    For more info see: http://reprap.org/pipermail/reprap-dev/2011-May/003323.html
*   Full endstop support
*   SD Card support
*   SD Card folders (works in pronterface)
*   SD Card autostart support
*   LCD support (ideally 20x4)
*   LCD menu system for autonomous SD card printing, controlled by an click-encoder.
*   EEPROM storage of e.g. max-velocity, max-acceleration, and similar variables
*   Arc support
*   Endstop trigger reporting to the host software.
*   Updated sdcardlib
*   Configurable serial port to support connection of wireless adaptors.
*   RC Servo Support, specify angle or duration for continuous rotation servos.

The default baudrate is 250000. This baudrate has less jitter and hence errors than the usual 115200 baud, but is less supported by drivers and host-environments.

Configuring and compilation:
============================

Install the arduino software IDE/toolset v23 (Some configurations also work with 1.x.x)
   http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Download the Marlin firmware
   https://github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin/tree/Marlin_v1
   Use the "Download Zip" button on the right.

For gen6/gen7 and sanguinololu the Sanguino directory in the Marlin dir needs to be copied to the arduino environment.
  copy ArduinoAddons\Arduino_x.x.x\sanguino <arduino home>\hardware\Sanguino

Start the arduino IDE.
Select Tools -> Board -> Arduino Mega 2560    or your microcontroller
Select the correct serial port in Tools ->Serial Port
Open Marlin.pde

Click the Verify/Compile button

Click the Upload button
If all goes well the firmware is uploading

That's ok.  Enjoy Silky Smooth Printing.

Instructions for configuring Bed Auto Leveling
===============================================
Uncomment the "ENABLE_AUTO_BED_LEVELING" define (commented by default)

You will probably need a swivel Z-MIN endstop in the extruder. A rc servo do a great job.
Check the system working here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IKMeOYz-1Q (Enable English subtitles)
Teasing ;-) video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8eqSQNAyro

In order to get the servo working, you need to enable:

* \#define NUM_SERVOS 1 // Servo index starts with 0 for M280 command

* \#define SERVO_ENDSTOPS {-1, -1, 0} // Servo index for X, Y, Z. Disable with -1

* \#define SERVO_ENDSTOP_ANGLES {0,0, 0,0, 165,60} // X,Y,Z Axis Extend and Retract angles


The first define tells firmware how many servos you have.
The second tells what axis this servo will be attached to. In the example above, we have a servo in Z axis.
The third one tells the angle in 2 situations: Probing (165ยบ) and resting (60ยบ). Check this with command M280 P0 S{angle} (example: M280 P0 S60 moves the servo to 60ยบ)

For RAMPS users:
----------------

By default, RAMPS have no power on servo bus (if you happen to have a multimeter, check the voltage on servo power pins).
In order to get the servo working, you need to supply 5V to 5V pin.. You can do it using your power supply (if it has a 5V output) or jumping the "Vcc" from Arduino to the 5V RAMPS rail.
These 2 pins are located just between the Reset Button and the yellow fuses... There are marks in the board showing 5V and VCC.. just connect them..
If jumping the arduino Vcc do RAMPS 5V rail, take care to not use a power hungry servo, otherwise you will cause a blackout in the arduino board ;-)


Next you need to define the Z endstop (probe) offset from hotend.
My preferred method:

* a) Make a small mark in the bed with a marker/felt-tip pen.
* b) Place the hotend tip as *exactly* as possible on the mark, touching the bed. Raise the hotend 0.1mm (a regular paper thickness) and zero all axis (G92 X0 Y0 Z0);
* d) Raise the hotend 10mm (or more) for probe clearance, lower the Z probe (Z-Endstop) with M401 and place it just on that mark by moving X, Y and Z;
* e) Lower the Z in 0.1mm steps, with the probe always touching the mark (it may be necessary to adjust X and Y as well) until you hear the "click" meaning the mechanical endstop was trigged. You can confirm with M119;
* f) Now you have the probe in the same place as your hotend tip was before. Perform a M114 and write down the values, for example: X:24.3 Y:-31.4 Z:5.1;
* g) You can raise the z probe with M402 command;
* h) Fill the defines bellow multiplying the values by "-1" (just change the signal)


* \#define X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -24.3
* \#define Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 31.4
* \#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -5.1


The following options define the probing positions. These are good starting values.
I recommend to keep a better clearance from borders in the first run and then make the probes as close as possible to borders:

* \#define LEFT_PROBE_BED_POSITION 30
* \#define RIGHT_PROBE_BED_POSITION 140
* \#define BACK_PROBE_BED_POSITION 140
* \#define FRONT_PROBE_BED_POSITION 30

A few more options:

* \#define XY_TRAVEL_SPEED 6000

X and Y axis travel speed between probes, in mm/min.
Bear in mind that really fast moves may render step skipping. 6000 mm/min (100mm/s) is a good value.

* \#define Z_RAISE_BEFORE_PROBING 10
* \#define Z_RAISE_BETWEEN_PROBINGS 10

The Z axis is lifted when traveling to the first probe point by Z_RAISE_BEFORE_PROBING value
and then lifted when traveling from first to second and second to third point by Z_RAISE_BETWEEN_PROBINGS.
All values are in mm as usual. 

That's it.. enjoy never having to calibrate your Z endstop neither leveling your bed by hand anymore ;-)
